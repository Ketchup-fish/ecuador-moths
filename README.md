## Directory Information

- ``images/``
    The images as provided by Brehm et al

- ``imagelist.txt``
    The filenames relative to the dataset directory.
    Each line contains a separate image.

- ``labels.txt``
    The class IDs for each image in imagelist.txt. Each line
    in labels.txt corresponds to the image in the same line
    in imagelist.txt

- ``tr_ID.txt``
    The train-test-split for each image in imagelist.txt. Each line
    in tr_ID.txt corresponds to the image in the same line in 
    imagelist.txt. A value of 1 means, this image is used for training,
    a value of 0 means this image is used for testing.
